## Abstract
This corresponds to the final examination of the group project for the High Performance Computing class. It presents an example of how Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm, can be trained to play a modified version of the classic game Space Invaders. Also it will give an overview of how these neural networks work, and how they evolve to get better at playing the game. The results of the NEAT algorithm will then be discussed, finding ways to improve training and run time.


## Description
The main objective of this project is to train a neural network using a Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm to play Space Invaders using a reward system. Instead of relying on a fixed structure for a neural network, NEAT allows it to evolve through a genetic algorithm. This model will be trained so its decision making process gets it closer to beating the game, in other words, get the highest score possible. Although the game does continue for infinity, getting 500,000 points is a benchmark at which you beat the game.
