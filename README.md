# CIIC5019 Project: NEAT Space Invaders

This corresponds to the final examination of the group project for the High Performance Computing class. It presents an example of how Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm, can be trained to play a modified version of the classic game Space Invaders. Also it will give an overview of how these neural networks work, and how they evolve to get better at playing the game. The results of the NEAT algorithm will then be discussed, finding ways to improve training and run time.
